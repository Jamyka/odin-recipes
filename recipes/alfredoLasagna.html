    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a great recipe. As one of the reviewers mentioned it's a little messy to roll them but I preservered
        and
        kept them a little tighter at the beginning of the roll; keeping as much of the topping inside the roll as
        possible. They were pretty big rolls and turned out great. I also used 3 breasts as someone else did and
        spooned
        some Alfredo and cheese on the top before baking. I will definitely make this again the ranch mix throws a
        nice
        taste in the mix! the family loved it!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li> 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

        <li> 1 cup Alfredo sauce, or as desired</li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup crumbled cooked bacon, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li> 1 pinch dried oregano, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine evaporated milk, chicken, and ranch dressing mix in a skillet over medium heat; cook until
            chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Shred chicken.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water,
            stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and dry on paper
            towels.</li>
        <li>Spread Alfredo sauce over each noodle; top with shredded chicken.</li>
        <li>Combine mozzarella cheese, bacon, oregano, and garlic salt in a bowl; sprinkle over chicken layer.
            Roll each noodle around the filling and place rolls in an 8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
